CRUD flashcard app which I have been working on throughout the bootcamp

**Implementation**
This is built in C# utilizing Microsoft SQL Server and a DAO pattern

**Steps Involved**
- Created database in Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio which contains each module and unit we've worked on in the bootcamp
- Built out Models in Visual Studio and implementation of SQL queries through DAO pattern
- Practiced OOP principles through separating duties of program to multiple classes

**Future Steps**
- Build out API controller and client side of the app
